When your coworker finishes up some code that they want to merge to the team's code base, they might send it to you for review. You provide feedback and suggestions, and then they may make changes and send it back to you. When you are happy with the code, you approve and it gets merged to the team's code base.\n",

You are in a team and there will be differences in preferences. The goal of code review isn't to make all code follow your personal preferences, but a standard of quality for the whole team."

Using a Python code linter like pylint can automatically check for coding standards and PEP 8 guidelines for you! It's also a good idea to agree on a style guide as a team to handle disagreements on code style, whether that's an existing style guide or one you create together incrementally as a team."

They also may have done it a certain way intentionally, and framing it as a suggestion promotes a constructive discussion, rather than opposition."
